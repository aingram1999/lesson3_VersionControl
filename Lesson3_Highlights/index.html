            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One of the main concepts we learned about in lesson 3 is what a Version Control System(VCS) is. The main feature of a version control system is that it records changes to files over time so that the user can recall any of these versions. This makes it very hard for the user to lose or accidentally delete his work since the system saves multiple versions. It also makes it easier for teams of developers to edit files at the same time. It allows you to see who edited the file and when. This makes it easier for the team to debug and see who introduced bugs.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is just a place where you can store things. In the case of programming, it is meant as a place to store files or sets of files. A remote repository is a repository that is hosted on a separate server in which a team can use. I am pretty sure this is what github is. A local repository is one that is hosted on the machine that the user is using. There are two ways to make a local repository. The first is that you create a new repository, and the second method is that you clone an existing remote repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git and Github are not the same thing. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. In a distributed VCS, every user has the local repository data on their machine. In fact, everything is local so processes can run much faster. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 when he created the Linux client. Git has a lot of commands, but the three we learned about the most were add, commit, and push. Doing these commands allows you to add a local file to github. Git will also prevent an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In this section I want to go over some of the various git commands and explain how they work. First there is "git init." This is the command to create an empty git repository or reinitialize an existing one. git add --all is the command to add all the file contents to the index. git commit records changes to the repository. git log is the command to show commit logs. On one hand the git pull command fetches from and integrates with another repository or local branch. On the other hand git push Updates remote refs along with associated objects</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems have many benefits. One of these it that files can't be overwritten so you cannot lose your work. Another major advantage is that more than one person can work on the same file without contradicting each other. It also keeps a lot of saves so that you can revert back to any previous version you may have had. This helps if you may have messed up a file beyond repair.</p>
